# System Scripts

This repo contains Bash scripts I’m writing while learning system engineering.  
All scripts are tested on macOS Terminal. Organized by purpose.

## Structure
- `basics/`: Intro scripts and learning notes
- `automation/`: File backup, cron jobs, cleanup tools
- `monitoring/`: Scripts for system status, memory, CPU, etc.
- `file-tools/`: Rename, sort, and handle bulk files

## How to Run
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
